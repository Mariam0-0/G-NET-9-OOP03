            //Q1: Identify the type of relationship in each scenario below(Inheritance, Association, Aggregation, Composition, or Dependency):

            //a) A University has Departments. If the university is closed, the departments no longer exist.
            //b) A Driver uses a Car.The driver does not own the car.
            //c) A Dog is an Animal.
            //d) A Team has Players. If the team is deleted, the players still exist.
            //e) A method receives a Logger as a parameter and calls it inside the method only.
            // ===============================================================================

            //a) A University has Departments. If the university is closed, the departments no longer exist.

            // Composition relationship since this is a HAS-A strong relationship

            // ===============================================================================
            //b) A Driver uses a Car.The driver does not own the car.

            // Association relationship 

            // ===============================================================================
            //c) A Dog is an Animal.

            // Inheritance relationship, since this is a IS-A relationship

            // ===============================================================================
            //d) A Team has Players. If the team is deleted, the players still exist.

            // Aggregation relationship, since this is a weak HAS-A relationship

            // ===============================================================================
            //e) A method receives a Logger as a parameter and calls it inside the method only.

            // Dependency relationship, since the class object is used as a parameter in a function

            //a) A parent class has a protected field.Can a child class in a different assembly access it? What about through an object instance from outside?
            //b) What is the difference between protected internal and private protected?
            //c) What does the sealed keyword do when applied to a class? What about when applied to a method?
            //d) Can you create an object from a sealed class using new? Why or why not?

            //Part 02 : Practical(Extending the Movie Ticket Booking System)
            //In Assignments 01 & 02, you built a Movie Ticket Booking System with a Ticket class, properties, indexers, and static members.Now you will refactor and extend it using inheritance, composition, and sealed classes.
            //What you need to build :

            //1. Create a base class Ticket with:
            //a.MovieName(string), Price(decimal, must be > 0), TicketId(int, read-only, auto-incremented).
            //b.A constructor that takes movieName and price.
            //c.A computed property PriceAfterTax that returns the price with 14% tax.
            //d.Override ToString() to return the ticket info.
            //e.A static int GetTotalTickets() method that returns the total number of tickets created.

            //2. Create three child classes that inherit from Ticket:
            //a.StandardTicket — adds SeatNumber(string).
            //b.VIPTicket — adds LoungeAccess(bool) and ServiceFee(decimal) = 50.
            //c.IMAXTicket — adds Is3D(bool). If true, the price increases by 30 EGP.
            //Each child class should override ToString() to include its own extra info.


            //3. Create a Cinema class that has a CinemaName, a Projector object (created inside Cinema), and holds up to 20 tickets.Add:
            //a.AddTicket(Ticket t) — adds a ticket to the first available slot.
            //b.PrintAllTickets() — prints all tickets.
            //c.OpenCinema() and CloseCinema() — start/stop the projector.

            //4. In Main, do the following:
            //a.Create a Cinema and open it.
            //b.Create one of each ticket type (hardcoded data) and add them to the Cinema.
            //c.Print all tickets.
            //d.Close the Cinema.
